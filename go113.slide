* Overview

Released 3 September 2019

Highlights:

- Go Module mirror

- Error wrapping

- Number literal improvements

* Not Comprehensive

Full details: [[https://golang.org/doc/go1.13][Release Notes]]

* Generics!!!

* Generics

Are *not* in 1.13...

_Sorry._

There is a [[https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/go2draft-contracts.md][generics proposal]].

See Ian Lance Taylor's Gophercon 2019 talk for more details:

* Go Module mirror

* Go Module mirror

- Speeds up downloads

- Prevents dependencies from disappearing

* Go Module mirror

`go` `get` will now use the official module mirror by default

- Proxy: [[https://proxy.golang.org]]

A module mirror that will be used to download versions of publically available code.

- Checksum database: [[https://sum.golang.org]]

Authenticates versioned code to prevent unauthorized modification of code.

- Index: [[https://index.golang.org]]

JSON feed of new module versions published through the official proxy.

* Go Module mirror

By default Go will use Google's default proxy, or direct download if not found.

`GOPROXY` to use your own proxy...

Or another public one like [[https://athens.azurefd.net]] (experimental)

Or create a comma separated heirarchy.

Or set to `GOPROXY=direct` to opt out of proxies entirely.

To opt out of downloading modules at all, use `GOPROXY=off`

* Other module improvements

`GO111MODULE` is still `auto`, but works even inside `GOPATH`.

`GOPRIVATE` indicates non-public module paths.

`go` `get`:

- `@latest` will get the newest minor release.

- `@upgrade` will get the newest minor release... but won't downgrade from a release candidate.

- `@patch` will get the latest patch release (v1.2.x)... and also won't downgrade.

* Error wrapping

* Error wrapping

Most errors are just strings... concatenated strings. Bleah.

Even if you have your own error type, it can get polluted by a package higher up the stack. Can no longer match on sentinel errors.

Wrapping errors allows us to create a meaningful chain of errors that we can still examine.

* Error wrapping

To take advantage of error wrapping, add method:

.code go113.go /START UNWRAP INTERFACE OMIT/,/END UNWRAP INTERFACE OMIT/

* Error wrapping

To get to the next error in a chain:

.code go113.go /START UNWRAP DEFINITION OMIT/,/END UNWRAP DEFINITION OMIT/

To see if any errors in the chain match a given error:

.code go113.go /START IS DEFINITION OMIT/,/END IS DEFINITION OMIT/

For example:

.code go113.go /START IS EXAMPLE1 OMIT/,/END IS EXAMPLE1 OMIT/

or

.code go113.go /START IS EXAMPLE2 OMIT/,/END IS EXAMPLE2 OMIT/

* Error wrapping

Find a matching error type and start using it:

.code go113.go /START AS DEFINITION OMIT/,/END AS DEFINITION OMIT/

For example:

.play go113.go /START AS EXAMPLE OMIT/,/END AS EXAMPLE OMIT/

* Error wrapping

`fmt.Errorf()` now supports `%w`

`%w` behaves identical to `%v`, but is only for wrapped errors.

* Number Literals

* Number Literals

- Binary integer literals: `0b01100110`

- Octal integer literals: `0o660`

- Hecadecimal floating point literals: `0x1.0p-1021`

- Imaginary literals: Huh?

* Number literals

Digit separator: `_` (underscore):

- `1_000_000_000`

- `0x_DEAD_BEEF`

- `0b_11_000000`

* Other improvements

* Escape Analysis

More memory allocated on the stack rather than the heap

* Out of range panics

Now include the index and length of the slice:

.code go113.go /START INDEX PANIC OMIT/,/END INDEX PANIC OMIT/

* TLS 1.3

Is now default.

Can be disabled by adding `tls13=0` to `GODEBUG`.

Opt-out will be gone in 1.14.

* database/sql

Now has a `NullTime`.

How did this take until 1.13?!

I personally will stick to pointers for nullable fields.

* reflect

`Value.IsZero()` does what you'd expect

* sync.Pool

No longer increase stop-the-world pause times.

No more complete repopulation after every garbage collection.

* godoc

Webserver is now removed from main distribution.

To manually install it:

.code go113.go /START godoc OMIT/,/END godoc OMIT/

* Lots of other changes

Again, full details are in the [[https://golang.org/doc/go1.13][Release Notes]]
